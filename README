This library is a starting work towards a wrapper that can convert most SCORM course operations to cmi5.  At this point, it is not a fully validating SCORM adapter, and is only expected to work with SCORM 1.2 courses that have lighter expectations around the usage of the standard.  

Details about the library's operation can be found in our presentation here: https://www.jcasolutions.com/scorm_to_cmi5.pdf

Upcoming work includes:
  * SCORM 2004 support
  * Thin vs. fat storage layers
  * Better SCORM iterable key support
